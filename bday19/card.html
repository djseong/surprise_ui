          Hi Mitch,
          <br><br>
          Happy Birthday!!!
          <br><br>
          When I was making your present for your other two birthdays I would always look 
          to the past to recall our happy memories and the qualities I admire about you. But for this birthday I feel a little different. 
          To be sure, we've made many more happy memories since last July and your attractive qualities have only continued to grow on me. 
          This birthday feels different because I thought more about the future than the past. We're both entering a new period
          in our lives and that is a pretty big thing for me. I don't know if I've told you this before but I'm actually really bad with transitions.
          My worst years in school were 6th grade, 9th grade, and freshmen year in college. I'm pretty sure next year is also going to be rough and
          honestly that scares me because I feel like there isn't that much I can do to prepare for it. I think that's why I've been paying extra
          attention to things like housing and finances that I can somewhat control. But even though I know all of that and am anticipating that I'm
          going to struggle next year, I'm still excited to start it with you. I'm not just saying that because I'll have a close friend nearby, although
          that is also very reassuring. I'm sure we'll have a lot of fun exploring Seattle and living real lives as (almost) neighbors. But I'm mainly
          saying that I'm excited because I know the biggest way I'm going to grow in my post grad life is spiritually and I can't think of a better person
          to share that with than you. I remember I told Sam the most important thing he has to cultivate in exec team is a spiritual trust amongst the 
          members. I realized there are very few people I spiritually trust, and there's even fewer people that I both spiritually trust and also get along
          naturally very well. The fact that I have that with you makes me excited because it means I'm going to be able to both share and grow in the most important thing
          with a person I care about. I know I'm still pretty bad at sharing and talking about these things - a lot of this sharing and growing is 
          still pretty theoretical haha. But I'll work towards it because at least in my head it's a really nice vision. I think it's what God wants
          for us. 
          <br><br>
          So I know that was a lot about me on your birthday, but I was thinking about how to make this card meaningful and I thought that would
          be writing things that only I would say to only you. So these are the genuine thoughts I've been having for us and the conclusion is that 
          you're great, I'm very happy to be dating you, and I'm super excited to start post grad with you. 
        <br><br>
          Happy birthday! 
          <br><br>-Dan
