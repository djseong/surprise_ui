    I hope your break has been going well so far. Say hi to Betsy and Eden and your parents for me. Oh and also Andy so that he likes me. I hope you've been able to finally find rest from everything and I hope that you are happy. You really deserve it. I also hope that you have a merry Christmas. I've been thinking recently about how to make room for Jesus this Christmas. It's an interesting mix of being intentional and not being intentional. Like you said before, I think I've also felt a little out of touch with Jesus. I hope that this break can be a chance for both of us to make room to let God write his story in our lives. I think that would be really awesome. I also think it's really encouraging that we're both praying for each other. That image of us praying for each other and supporting each other in our faith is really beautiful in my mind. I'm really glad that I got to meet you Mitch. No matter what happens, I'm really glad God brought us together.

    So I thought about what to give you so that you can get to know me better. That part was pretty easy - you gave me a book to read because you read a lot, so I'll give you a kdrama to watch because I watch kdramas a lot. I figured it would be fair because there's around 20 1hr episodes and that's probably how long it'll take me to read the book. The hard part was thinking of which one to give you. The first one that came to mind was one about a guy and a girl that have been best friends for 17 years. It reminds me of our friendship and it's one that I kept thinking about this past spring semester and summer. It's not the best kdrama out there but I found it pretty relatable and thought provoking at times. I would like you to watch it, but at the same time I remember you said you wanted to relax and not think about this stuff too much. So you can either watch that one, or another one about a female psychiatrist dating a male author. It's also about mental disorders which is pretty unique in kdramas. That drama made me think more about people's past histories and scars they might be carrying. Whichever one you pick, I think it'll show you a bit more about the things I enjoy, find funny, and value. The two links below are for the two dramas in that order. After you click the link you can log in to Viki with email: dseong01@college.harvard.edu and password: danielseong to watch it without ads.

    Anyways, thanks for everything Mitch. Thanks for a really unpredicatable, emotional, stressful, and overall amazing year. I hope you know that you are very special. To God, to your friends, to your family, and to me.
