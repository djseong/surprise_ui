        <p> Hey Mitch. What a day to celebrate. I had a feeling that today would be a good idea to give you something. No particular reason, just coincidence that today also happens to be Ash Wednesday I suppose. Anyways, I have a word document on my computer called mitch.docx and I've added to it a few times over the course of our relationship. We talked about it briefly after winter break but I thought you would like to see the rest of it. I told you this before but whenever I write my thoughts it's very succinct so I'm not sure how much you will understand but I think you know me so we'll see. Let me know if you find this so I know you got the meaning of the rock. Oh, and btw I'm still not sick of you yet. </p>
        <button type="button" id="present" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" 
        onClick="document.location.href='mitch.html'" >mitch.doc</button>
