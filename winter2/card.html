    I'm not sure if you remember but this card looks pretty similar to last year (do you like the lights though?). I used last year's as a template which did make my life easier but it also gave me a chance to read what I wrote last year at this time. I actually remember pretty well what I was thinking. I was scared to express how much you meant to me because I didn't know where we would end up so I mainly talked about what I knew we would have in common no matter what happened - which was our relationships with God. I said last year that I hope we could use this time to make room for Jesus to write His story in our lives. Even though we are in a very different spot than last year :) I still feel the same way about that part. Thanks for telling me to pray more - I took that to heart and am trying to start each day with devotionals and prayer. Let's pray a lot this break and I hope by the end of break our desires will be more aligned with God's desires. I think that would be a really good way to start our last semester. Thanks for sticking it through with me Mitch. I've learned that I'm easily frustrated and an even worse communicator than I thought. But I think you're helping me grow and to be honest, it's been pretty fun. So thanks Mitch and I look forward to playing more with you :).

    So also similarly to last year, I want to give you a kdrama to watch. It's called Shining Inheritance and it's about this really nice girl who has a pretty tough life and is suddenly given a huge inheritance by this grandma. It's also about this immature guy growing up and reconciling with his family. Oh, and of course there's also romance between the two. I think you will grow to really like some of the characters (and really hate others). It's a little long...but I think you can do it! It's still shorter than the 50 episode one I watched so don't worry. As a reminder, you can login as dseong01@college.harvard.edu and password: danielseong to watch it.

    Anyways, thanks for everything Mitch. Thanks for a really unpredicatable, emotional, stressful, and overall amazing year. I hope you know that you are very special. To God, to your friends, to your family, and to me. :)
